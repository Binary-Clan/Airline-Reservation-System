# Introduction

Hello everyone! Welcome to this demonstration of our online airline reservation system architecture. Today, I'll walk you through the various components of our system, how they interact with each other, and the technologies we used to build it. Let's start with an overview. Our system is designed using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility. It consists of several layers and components that work together to provide a seamless booking experience.

## Client Applications

First, we have the client applications. Currently, we have a web application, and in the future, we'll be developing a mobile application. Users can interact with our system through these client apps.

## Frontend

The frontend of our web application is built using React. This user interface layer handles all user interactions and communicates with the backend services through our API Gateway.

To manage data fetching and state management, we use **Axios** and **React Tanstack Query**.

- **Axios**: This is our HTTP client library. It simplifies making requests to our backend services and handling responses.
- **React Tanstack Query**: This library helps manage server state in React applications. It provides powerful tools for caching, synchronizing, and updating data in the application, improving both performance and user experience.

## Backend Services

Our backend services are built using Java Spring Boot and follow a microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and has its own separate PostgreSQL database for data storage. Here are the key microservices:

1. **User Service**:
    - Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.
    - Uses JWT tokens for authentication, ensuring secure communication.
    - Uses MongoDB database for storing media data.
2. **Flight Information Service**:
    - Handles flight data, including schedules, availability, and details.
    - Keeps the information up-to-date by interacting with airline databases.
3. **Reservation Service**:
    - Manages the process of booking flights.
    - Handles seat selection, payment processing, and reservation confirmation.
4. **Reservation View Service**:
    - Allows users to view their booking details and itineraries.
    - Provides an interface for users to manage their reservations.

## Load Balancer

To distribute incoming requests evenly across our backend services, we use a load balancer. This ensures high availability and reliability by preventing any single service from becoming a bottleneck.

## Security

Security is a crucial aspect of our system. We use Spring Security to implement authentication and authorization. JWT tokens are used to authenticate users, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific services.

### JWT Service Authentication
![jwt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bf095c4-4012-463d-8e15-63cfeff9d0f1)

For secure access control, this application employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. We've implemented a JwtService utilizing a dedicated spring security library to handle JWT token generation, validation, and parsing. This ensures secure communication between clients and microservices.

Here only /Register and /authenticate end points are open endpoints for any user without a valid JWT token. Above two endpoints supply JWT tokens for the user. For accessing the other services in the airline application this token should be sent with the request in the authentication bearer token. Valid users with correct JWT token are granted.

## Databases

Each microservice has its own PostgreSQL database, ensuring data separation and easier management. For media storage, such as user profile pictures, we use MongoDB due to its ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently.

## Design Decisions

The decision to split the airline reservation system into multiple microservices was driven by the need for scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. This decomposition allows each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, enhancing the system's overall robustness. The Frontend Service acts as the user interface, interacting with backend services through the API Gateway, ensuring seamless user experiences for searching flights, making reservations, and viewing bookings. 

The Flight Information Service manages and provides flight data, ensuring up-to-date flight details are available for search and booking, and can be scaled to handle high loads efficiently. The Reservation Service handles booking operations, maintaining data integrity and consistency, and can be optimized for peak booking periods. The Reservation Viewer Service allows users to view and manage reservations, providing easy access to booking information and ensuring responsive performance. Each microservice contributes to a modular and scalable architecture, with the API Gateway offering a unified entry point, managing routing, security, and request aggregation. This design ensures the system can evolve with changing requirements, handle varying loads, and be maintained with minimal disruption, ultimately enhancing the reliability and performance of the airline reservation system.

## Microservices

### Implementaion Methods

The implementation of the microservices for the airline reservation system primarily utilized Spring Boot and Netflix Eureka. Each microservice, including the frontend service, flight information service, reservation service, and reservation viewer service, was developed using Spring Boot, which facilitated rapid development and deployment.

Netflix Eureka served as the service registry, where each microservice registered itself upon startup. This enabled the API Gateway to discover and route requests dynamically to the appropriate service instances. The service discovery mechanism provided by Eureka ensured that the microservices could scale independently and handle failover efficiently, as it automatically updated the registry with the available instances of each service.

For load balancing, Spring Cloud Load Balancer was used. This approach distributed incoming requests evenly across the available service instances registered with Eureka, ensuring efficient utilization of resources and improving the system's responsiveness and reliability. By leveraging Spring's built-in load balancing capabilities, we avoided the complexity of integrating additional tools like Netflix Ribbon.

This implementation method, combining Netflix Eureka for service discovery and Spring Cloud Load Balancer for load balancing, provided an effective solution for managing the microservices in the airline reservation system. This setup allowed for independent scaling, ensuring the system could handle the demands of a dynamic and high-traffic application while maintaining simplicity and ease of management.

## Discovery Server
![Service_Registry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec6adb78-9081-4975-a7e3-0fbb067e5145)

Service discovery is a key component in microservices architecture, enabling services to dynamically find and communicate with each other. This mechanism ensures that each service can discover the network locations of other services, facilitating seamless interaction. Using tools like Spring Cloud Eureka, services can register themselves at runtime, updating their instances in a centralized registry. This registry maintains the current locations of all services, providing clients with the necessary information to call other services without hardcoding their addresses.

In this project, we have four microservices running as Eureka clients, each registered with the Eureka server as shown in the image. The Flight-Information-Service provides flight details, while the Frontend-Service handles the user interface, enabling users to interact with the system. The Reservation-Service manages booking details and communicates with the Reservation-Viewer-Service, which allows users to view their reservations. These services register with Eureka, ensuring they can be dynamically discovered and scaled, enhancing the robustness and flexibility of the application. To implement the Service discovery, we created a new microservice ‚Äúservice-registry‚Äù. This has the dependency of Eureka Server in the pom.xml file. Other microservices were registered as Eureka clients by defining related dependencies in them. This slide shows how our services has registered as instances. in the Eureka server. This helps to direct API requests to the correct service without hardcoding their service URLs.

## API Gateway
![2 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b99dcabf-dfc2-47c7-bc91-438aac1b509c)

API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy, providing a single entry point for all client requests to our microservices-based airline reservation system. It routes requests to the appropriate services‚Äîfrontend, flight information, reservation, and reservation viewer‚Äîensuring simplified client interaction and consistent request handling. The gateway enforces security policies, including authentication and authorization, and implements rate limiting to protect against abuse. It also manages service discovery and load balancing, ensuring high availability and reliability. Centralized logging and monitoring aid in performance optimization and debugging. By transforming and aggregating requests and responses, the API Gateway enhances efficiency and reduces client-side complexity, making it an essential component of our system's architecture.

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5f27af5-3135-40a5-8c19-0c54ee098305)

In this setup, an API request is sent through the API Gateway to the FLIGHT-INFORMATION-SERVICE. The service is registered on the Eureka server, which acts as a service registry. When a client sends a request to the API Gateway at http://localhost:8765/FLIGHT-INFORMATION-SERVICE/airline_reservation/api/flights, the gateway uses the service discovery mechanism to locate the FLIGHT-INFORMATION-SERVICE from Eureka. It then forwards the request to the appropriate instance of the flight information service. The gateway dynamically routes the request based on the service name, and the flight information service processes the request and returns the response. This setup simplifies client interactions by providing a single access point, handles service discovery and routing, and ensures that the client doesn't need to know the actual locations of the microservices.


## User Interface

### Implementation
#### Frameworks, and Tools Used
In the development of the Aero Express Airline Reservation System, we utilized a combination of modern frameworks and tools to create a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly interface. The following sections detail the implementation of the UI, along with the frameworks and tools employed.

API testing tools like Postman were essential in testing the application's APIs to ensure they functioned correctly and met the requirements. Postman was used to send requests to various endpoints exposed by the microservices, such as the flight information service, reservation service, and reservation viewer service, through the API Gateway. It allowed for the verification of request and response formats, ensuring that the APIs returned the expected data. Postman's features, such as automated testing scripts and environment variables, facilitated efficient testing across different scenarios and environments. By using Postman, we were able to validate the behavior of each microservice independently, ensuring they communicated correctly through the API Gateway and delivered the expected results to the frontend. This rigorous testing process helped identify and fix issues early, ensuring the reliability and performance of the airline reservation system.
