# Introduction

Hello everyone! Welcome to this demonstration of our online airline reservation system architecture. Today, I'll walk you through the various components of our system, how they interact with each other, and the technologies we used to build it. Let's start with an overview. Our system is designed using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility. It consists of several layers and components that work together to provide a seamless booking experience.

## Client Applications

First, we have the client applications. Currently, we have a web application, and in the future, we'll be developing a mobile application. Users can interact with our system through these client apps.

## Frontend

The frontend of our web application is built using React. This user interface layer handles all user interactions and communicates with the backend services through our API Gateway.

To manage data fetching and state management, we use **Axios** and **React Tanstack Query**.

- **Axios**: This is our HTTP client library. It simplifies making requests to our backend services and handling responses.
- **React Tanstack Query**: This library helps manage server state in React applications. It provides powerful tools for caching, synchronizing, and updating data in the application, improving both performance and user experience.

## Backend Services

Our backend services are built using Java Spring Boot and follow a microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and has its own separate PostgreSQL database for data storage. Here are the key microservices:

1. **User Service**:
    - Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.
    - Uses JWT tokens for authentication, ensuring secure communication.
    - Uses MongoDB database for storing media data.
2. **Flight Information Service**:
    - Handles flight data, including schedules, availability, and details.
    - Keeps the information up-to-date by interacting with airline databases.
3. **Reservation Service**:
    - Manages the process of booking flights.
    - Handles seat selection, payment processing, and reservation confirmation.
4. **Reservation View Service**:
    - Allows users to view their booking details and itineraries.
    - Provides an interface for users to manage their reservations.

## Load Balancer

To distribute incoming requests evenly across our backend services, we use a load balancer. This ensures high availability and reliability by preventing any single service from becoming a bottleneck.

## Security

Security is a crucial aspect of our system. We use Spring Security to implement authentication and authorization. JWT tokens are used to authenticate users, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific services.

### JWT Service Authentication
![jwt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bf095c4-4012-463d-8e15-63cfeff9d0f1)

For secure access control, this application employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. We've implemented a JwtService utilizing a dedicated spring security library to handle JWT token generation, validation, and parsing. This ensures secure communication between clients and microservices.

Here only /Register and /authenticate end points are open endpoints for any user without a valid JWT token. Above two endpoints supply JWT tokens for the user. For accessing the other services in the airline application this token should be sent with the request in the authentication bearer token. Valid users with correct JWT token are granted.

## Databases

Each microservice has its own PostgreSQL database, ensuring data separation and easier management. For media storage, such as user profile pictures, we use MongoDB due to its ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently.

## Microservices

#### Introduction to the Netflix OSS Stack
For our Airline Reservation System, we utilized several components from the Netflix OSS (Open Source Software) stack to ensure a robust, scalable, and resilient microservices architecture. The tools we used include:
- **Eureka**: A service registry for service discovery, allowing microservices to find each other.
- **Ribbon**: A client-side load balancer that distributes the load among multiple instances of a microservice.
- **Hystrix**: A latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services, and 3rd-party libraries.
- **Zuul**: An edge service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more.

#### Explanation of Why These Tools Were Chosen
- **Eureka**: Simplifies service discovery and registration, making the system more dynamic and scalable.
- **Ribbon**: Provides efficient client-side load balancing, improving response times and system reliability.
- **Hystrix**: Ensures system resilience by preventing cascading failures and providing fallback options during service disruptions.
- **Zuul**: Acts as a gateway for routing requests, enhancing security and allowing for centralized monitoring and management.

## Discovery Server
![Service_Registry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec6adb78-9081-4975-a7e3-0fbb067e5145)
Service discovery is a key component in microservices architecture, enabling services to dynamically find and communicate with each other. This mechanism ensures that each service can discover the network locations of other services, facilitating seamless interaction. Using tools like Spring Cloud Eureka, services can register themselves at runtime, updating their instances in a centralized registry. This registry maintains the current locations of all services, providing clients with the necessary information to call other services without hardcoding their addresses.

In this project, we have four microservices running as Eureka clients, each registered with the Eureka server as shown in the image. The Flight-Information-Service provides flight details, while the Frontend-Service handles the user interface, enabling users to interact with the system. The Reservation-Service manages booking details and communicates with the Reservation-Viewer-Service, which allows users to view their reservations. These services register with Eureka, ensuring they can be dynamically discovered and scaled, enhancing the robustness and flexibility of the application. To implement the Service discovery, we created a new microservice ‚Äúservice-registry‚Äù. This has the dependency of Eureka Server in the pom.xml file. Other microservices were registered as Eureka clients by defining related dependencies in them. This slide shows how our services has registered as instances. in the Eureka server. This helps to direct API requests to the correct service without hardcoding their service URLs.

## API Gateway
